# DontDie
Mod that if you someone dies it will spawn a random npc on a random player

Todo:
1. if boss is alive only randomly spawn bosses
2. make a toggle to only spawn bosses
3. figure out a better way to see if a npc is a boss
4. make it so hardmode npcs wont spawn if it is prehardmode
5. every time a boss naturally spawns make it plantera (ex. a horrible chill goes down you spine = plantera spawn instead of normal)
